An HMM-based Text-To-Speech System applied to Swedish
<br>
Department of Speech, Music and Hearing, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden Â· Apr 30, 2005. 
<br>
A new method for creating artificial speech through the use of HMM:s has been developed by a research team at The Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan. The technology employed has been compiled into a text-to-speech-system, HTS (HMM-based Text-to-Speech), which has already been adapted to several European languages. 
The object of this master's degree project was to adapt the HTS system to the Swedish language and evaluate it against an existing Text-To-Speech system.
